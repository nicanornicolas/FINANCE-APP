# Design Document

## Overview

The production finance application will be built as a modern, scalable web application using a microservices architecture with integrated KRA (Kenya Revenue Authority) tax services. The system will replace the current Streamlit-based application with a robust platform featuring a React frontend, FastAPI backend services, PostgreSQL database, and cloud-native deployment on AWS/Azure. The architecture emphasizes security, scalability, and maintainability while providing comprehensive financial management and KRA-compliant tax preparation capabilities for the Kenyan market.

```

## Error Handling

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid transaction data",
    "details": {
      "field": "amount",
      "reason": "Amount must be a positive number"
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req_123456"
  }
}
```

### Error Categories

1. **Validation Errors (400):** Invalid input data
2. **Authentication Errors (401):** Invalid credentials or expired tokens
